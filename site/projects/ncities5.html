        <p>19/02/26 Here is the github -> <a href="https://github.com/Tulk6/ncities5">https://github.com/Tulk6/ncities5</a><br><br>Site is made using a static site generator I am writing, which uses the mustache templating  engine and a big YAML file with all the posts and links and sections and this very text I'm writing rn!<br><br>A python script goes through a source directory which contains a) this YAML file, and b) the templates and then provides the  dict that it gets from reading the YAML file to the templates which do all the rest. Also does stuff to make a seperate file for each project and article and so on. It then puts all the compiled HTML into another folder along with CSS ive written and the fonts and images and so on,  and then another program I've written to interface with the neocities API uploads all the files, and syncs the local folder to the server  one. Hopefully 🤞🤞 this all means that although i already rlly wanna change the design and layout and so on of my site, doing so should only rlly mean rewriting the templates and the css, and not having to rewrite all the content itself. which I thought would be nice.<br><br>Still need to add some things (e.g. smth to resize photos that I upload so they take up less room &c &c but that can wait). <br><br>Also rlly recommend mustache. Very fun.<br><br>Okee buh bye.<br></p>
